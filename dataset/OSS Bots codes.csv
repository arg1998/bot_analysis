D8MKPN81L7GUEDY1,Not a strong preference. Given that the bot identified a false positive I would imagine that if the bot was to run automatically on every commit and then produce a large number of false positives developers might get frustrated and ignore its messages completely. It can be very time consuming for them to go through each error to validate its legitimacy. It’s best then if the developer can choose which commits they want the bot to run on - maybe more sensitive ones - and dedicate less time validating the bot’s results on trivial commits.,0,---> human initiate/accountable,---> hurting productivity,,,,Argues many different sides all at once,---> clear/concise,---> human initiate/accountable,
